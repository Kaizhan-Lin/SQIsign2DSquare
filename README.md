# Julia implementation of SQIsign2D^2

Our code is based on the SQIsign2D-East implementation (https://github.com/hiroshi-onuki/SQIsign2D-East.jl).
using [Julia](https://julialang.org)
and [Nemo](https://www.nemocas.org).

## Usage

You can run benchmark for SQIsign2D^2 and CompactSQIsign2D^2 at the NIST security levels 1, 3, and 5 by
```
$ julia bench.jl
```
